The term "soft skills" was created by the U.S. Army in the late 1960s. It refers to any skill that does not employ the use of machinery. The military realized that many important activities were included within this category, and in fact, the social skills necessary to lead groups, motivate soldiers, and win wars were encompassed by skills they had not yet catalogued or fully studied. Since 1959, the U.S. Army has been investing a considerable amount of resources into technology-based development of training procedures. In 1968 the U.S. Army officially introduced a training doctrine known as "Systems Engineering of Training" covered in the document CON Reg 350-100-1.[7][8]

PG Whitmore cited the CON Reg 350-100-1 definition: "job-related skills involving actions affecting primarily people and paper, e.g., inspecting troops, supervising office personnel, conducting studies, preparing maintenance reports, preparing efficiency reports, designing bridge structures."[9]

In 1972, a US Army training manual began the formal usage of the term "soft skills".[10] At the 1972 CONARC Soft Skills Conference, Dr. Whitmore presented a report[11][12][13] aimed at figuring out how the term "soft skills" is understood in various CONARC schools. After designing and processing a questionnaire, experts formulated a new tentative definition: "Soft skills are important job-related skills that involve little or no interaction with machines and whose application on the job is quite generalized."[11][13]

They further criticized the state of the concept then as vague with a remark "in other words, those job functions about which we know a good deal are hard skills and those about which we know very little are soft skills." Another immediate study by them also concluded in a negative tone.[11]

Psychologist Nicholas Humphrey famously stated that social intelligence, rather than qualitative intelligence, defines humans. Many industries today give prominence to the soft skills of their employees. Some companies now offer professional training of soft skills to their employees.

Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to
sustainable energy. Sony’s is to fill the world with emotion
through the power of creativity and technology. Coca-Cola’s is to
refresh the world and make a difference.
Each is an exceptional mission: simple, compelling, relevant,
and ambitious. They’re a bright North Star behind which an
organization can rally. But missions have their limitations.
A clear and powerful mission provides direction, but can such a
simple statement guide everyday work? Consider a Tesla engineer
logging on one Monday morning. She flips open her laptop, types
a quick hello to her colleagues on Slack… and then what? How
does she “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy”
from her kitchen table?
Likewise, how does a music producer at Sony fill the world
with emotion? How does a food scientist at Coca-Cola make a
difference in the world?
As we already mentioned, company missions act as North
Stars. They set the destination for an organization—but they
don’t explain how to get there. That relies on something else:
organizational strategy. But what is it?
 “The textbook definition is: the actions a company takes to
achieve long-term results,” explains Lotte Vester, Head of
Organizational Strategy at Asana. “If your mission specifies your destination, your strategy spells out how to get there.”
To see how everything fits together, consider a space agency.
These organizations have incredibly ambitious missions. They
plan to blast off from Earth and explore the whole universe. Faced
with such a grand purpose, it’s fascinating to imagine how an
executive could draw a path from their mission all the way down
to day-to-day work.

5. Depending on the frequency and dosage of the drug, the user will be classified into one of the 4 stages of addiction

Stage 1 - Experimentation 
● To feel good — feeling of pleasure, “high” or "intoxication"
● To feel better — relieve stress, forget problems, or feel numb
● To do better — improve performance or thinking 
● Curiosity and peer pressure

Stage 2: Regular Use &amp; Abuse Something that was once considered recreational or
temporary becomes a lifestyle. Users can suffer from exaggerated mood swings in between doses

Human: What are amphetamines?
AI: Amphetamines are a type of drug that increases alertness and energy. They can be used legally to treat conditions such as narcolepsy, but are also often abused for their stimulant effects. Amphetamines are dangerous drugs and can lead to addiction and serious health problems.

 Dear 42 Staff,
 With this letter, I want to express my interest and describe why I am applying for a scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn.
 I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith, I am the eldest of three children. As a child,
 I played a lot of sports and was always very active. When I was five, my mom enrolled me in karate classes. This is where I developed a passion for self-improvement and competition.
I am writing to express my appreciation for your generosity and to submit my application in hope of securing one of these spots. I desire to participate in 42. To express.
My goal is to use my education to give back to the community 
I'm excited to start my core curriculum and log in again to the workplace. I want to evaluate and be evaluated. 42 offers a fantastic curriculum that helps us improve our hard skills and also refine our ideal soft skills. As a child, I was very curious and loved exploring. When I was ten years old, my parents bought me a computer. It was then that I discovered coding - something that immediately captured my attention and imagination. Since then, I have been honing my skills by taking online courses and completing coding challenges on various platforms. 
As a child, I was always interested in the way things work. I liked to take my toys apart and put them back together, or build new ones out of scrap parts. This curiosity eventually led me to pursue a degree in 
Financial aid would allow me to focus on my studies without worrying about how to pay rent or buy food.
 I want to study at 42 Heilbronn. 
 I love writing code, this is exactly what I need to accomplish my goals

3. My dream is to be a tech start-up founder.
4. I would like to be surrounded by like-minded people.

I need the scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn. I am very good at programming and software development. My dream is to be a tech start-up founder. I would like to be surrounded by like-minded people. I have a growth mindset and high intrinsic motivation. I was born in Argentina. My mom is a housewife, who has demonstrated resilience and hard work ethics, and my dad is a blacksmith, so I am also tech-savvy, which has taught me a lot about how things work.
I am flexible and organized, I know how to follow a guideline but I can also learn things by myself. When I do something, I want to be the best at it.
This educational concept is unique, and I like the idea of students defining their learning path. Since my childhood, I dreamed about going to Academie de Paris and becoming a great artist. Although I didn't pursue that path, I enjoyed how free I was and the fact that I could study and do masterpieces, inspired by great artists. I like the idea of picking what you like, learning it deeply and becoming good at it.
Your method of teaching is so different to everything else out there, and there is always a small part of me out there that still has a dream of being an "artist". I see this course as a chance to be my best self at an art or craft and master it in a way I never thought possible.
I like the idea that 42 can teach me how to learn faster. Every college or university out there is teaching you how to learn at a slower and more academic rate, so this is a huge plus.
I have always been into tech stuff, I have taught myself codding and am very good at it. I don't handle so well the administrative part of my business. I use GnuCash, Latex, software and languages such as c, c++, java, BASH and POWERSHELL. I use Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Cubieboard, Odroid and Orange Pi. I have screwed my PC several times, formatting and partitioning them, installing and removing different operative systems, messing with the bios and overclocking the processor. For me, this is a hobby, so I find it hard to stop at the end of the day. I like DIY, and I look up tutorials a lot. I built a CNC from scratch. I spend a lot of time learning, in my spare time and I want to continue learning.
I want to make a change in the world. I want to be part of a universe in which everyone takes care of everyone else. Do you know how "they," say that mankind is devolving? I want to prove them wrong, that we can be great, better, good. I like to help other people, and I can now feel happy about it. I have grown and changed. I would like to be an example of someone who is consistently working to be the best person he can be, building himself with the help of others.
I think that a lot of people are quite limited in their thinking. They tend to only see things from one perspective, and they often don't question their assumptions or look at things from different angles. This can lead to a lot of problems, both for individuals and for society as a whole. I believe that it is important for everyone to try to think more broadly and deeply about the world around them and to question everything they take for granted. Only by doing this can we hope to truly understand the world and ourselves, and make better decisions throughout our lives.
 I want to express my appreciation for the community you are building at 42 Heilbronn. I think that this unconventional approach to education is attractive to people with a growth mindset and high intrinsic motivation. I am writing to apply for financial aid to start my studies on the next kickoff date.
 I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith, I am the eldest of three children. As a child, I had to work in my dad's forge to help the family make ends meet. I am very proud of my humble beginnings and I believe that they have made me into the hardworking and resilient person that I am today.
I started coding when I was 13 years old and it quickly became one of my favourite hobbies. When I was 16, I took part in a local programming competition and placed first in my province. This experience showed me that coding was something that I could be good at and motivated me to continue learning. A few years later, I completed a Software Engineering course at a university in Buenos Aires. Even though I enjoyed the course, I knew that it wasn't teaching me everything I needed to know to become a great software engineer. That's why 42 Heilbronn caught my attention: its unique approach covers not only technical skills but also important soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork and creative thinking.
Since moving out of my parents' house, I have been working various jobs to support myself while also taking online courses on Coursera (including an Introduction to Computer Science course) and Udacity (including a Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Nanodegree program). My long-term goal is to find a job as a software engineer in Germany so that I can be closer to my sister who lives here. For me to achieve this goal, studying at 42 Heilbronn is essential since it will give me the chance not only to improve my coding skills but also to learn about German culture and practice speaking German daily with other students from all over the world.
Apart from being passionate about code, some of my other interests include photography, cooking and hiking. On weekends you'll often find me exploring new trails in the area or trying out new recipes at home.
 This has given me a strong foundation in programming and data structures &amp; algorithms. The reason why I want to study at 42 Heilbronn is that it offers an innovative approach to learning which appeals to me. The project-based learning style will allow me to apply the theoretical knowledge that I have acquired during my studies so far. Moreover, the fact that there are no teachers or lectures but only mentors who are there to help when needed creates a very stimulating environment in which one can learn a lot by doing. Finally, the international atmosphere at 42 Heilbronn with students from all over the world is another factor that makes this school attractive to me. While I have loved learning and doing well in school, it has been a challenge financially. I have worked multiple jobs throughout high school and during breaks from college to help support myself and pay for tuition, books, and other expenses. I am writing to apply for the 42 Heilbronn scholarship because attending this coding Bootcamp would allow me to focus on my studies without worrying about how I will afford tuition or other associated costs. It would also mean being able to network with like-minded individuals and accessing resources that could help further my career goals. This opportunity would make pursuing my dream of becoming a software engineer possible, something that may otherwise be out of reach due to financial constraints. With this letter, I want to describe why I am applying to receive a scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn. I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith. As a child, I was exposed to the family business of making metal art.
 This is where my passion for sculpting originated. Living in Argentina, I became very interested in both ancient and modern cultures as well as their traditions. After high school, these interests led me to study archaeology at university which I completed with excellent grades. For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in how things work and taking them apart to see how they are put together. This curiosity led me to study physics in high school and then pursue a degree in electrical engineering at university. My studies have given me a strong foundation in mathematics and physics, which I believe will be essential in becoming a successful engineer. I am confident that I have what it takes to succeed at 42 Heilbronn. I am a hard worker who is not afraid of challenges. In addition, I am excited to learn more about engineering and meet other like-minded students from all over the world. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon. With this letter, I want to express my interest and describe why I am applying for a scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn. The main reason why I am applying is that 42 Heilbronn offers study courses in English and therefore globalization at university, which helps students prepare for work-life stress-free. Apart from the language barrier, other things like cultural differences can create big problems both inside and outside of school if one does not take them into account before studying there. In addition, I strongly believe that education should not only be about acquiring theoretical knowledge but also developing practical skills; And this is where 42 Heilbronn shines. The unique pedagogy used here through which students are taught to think creatively and solve complex problems will help me a lot in my future career as an engineer or software developer.

1. I need the scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn.

I need the scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn. I am very good at programming and software development. My dream is to be a tech start-up founder. I would like to be surrounded by like-minded people. I have a growth mindset and high intrinsic motivation. I was born in Argentina. My mom is a housewife, who has demonstrated resilience and hard work ethics, and my dad is a blacksmith, so I am also tech-savvy, which has taught me a lot about how things work.
I am flexible and organized, I know how to follow a guideline but I can also learn things by myself. When I do something, I want to be the best at it.
This educational concept is unique, and I like the idea of students defining their learning path. Since my childhood, I dreamed about going to Academie de Paris and becoming a great artist. Although I didn't pursue that path, I enjoyed how free I was and the fact that I could study and do masterpieces, inspired by great artists. I like the idea of picking what you like, learning it deeply and becoming good at it.
Your method of teaching is so different to everything else out there, and there is always a small part of me out there that still has a dream of being an "artist". I see this course as a chance to be my best self at an art or craft and master it in a way I never thought possible.
I like the idea that 42 can teach me how to learn faster. Every college or university out there is teaching you how to learn at a slower and more academic rate, so this is a huge plus.
I have always been into tech stuff, I have taught myself codding and am very good at it. I don't handle so well the administrative part of my business. I use GnuCash, Latex, software and languages such as c, c++, java, BASH and POWERSHELL. I use Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Cubieboard, Odroid and Orange Pi. I have screwed my PC several times, formatting and partitioning them, installing and removing different operative systems, messing with the bios and overclocking the processor. For me, this is a hobby, so I find it hard to stop at the end of the day. I like DIY, and I look up tutorials a lot. I built a CNC from scratch. I spend a lot of time learning, in my spare time and I want to continue learning.
I want to make a change in the world. I want to be part of a universe in which everyone takes care of everyone else. Do you know how "they," say that mankind is devolving? I want to prove them wrong, that we can be great, better, good. I like to help other people, and I can now feel happy about it. I have grown and changed. I would like to be an example of someone who is consistently working to be the best person he can be, building himself with the help of others.
I think that a lot of people are quite limited in their thinking. They tend to only see things from one perspective, and they often don't question their assumptions or look at things from different angles. This can lead to a lot of problems, both for individuals and for society as a whole. I believe that it is important for everyone to try to think more broadly and deeply about the world around them and to question everything they take for granted. Only by doing this can we hope to truly understand the world and ourselves, and make better decisions throughout our lives.

I need the scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn. I am very good at programming and software development. My dream is to be a tech start-up founder. I would like to be surounded by like-minded people. I have a growth mindset and high intrinsic motivation. I was born in Argentina. My mom is a housewife, who has demonstrated resilience and hard work ethics, and my dad is a blacksmith, so I am also tech-savvy, who has taught me a lot about how things work.
I am flexible and organized, I know how to follow a guideline but I can also learn things by myself. When I do something, I want to be the best at it.
This educational concept is unique, and I like the idea of students defining their own learning path. Since my childhood, I dreamed about going to Academie de Paris and become a great artist. Although I didn't pursue that path, I enjoyed how free I was and the fact that I could study and do masterpieces, inspired by great artists. I like the idea of picking what you like, learn it deeply and become really good at it.
Your method of teaching is so different to everything else out there, and there is always a small part of me out there that still has a dream of being an "artist". I see this course as a chance to be my best self at an art or craft and master it in way I never thought possible.
I like the idea that 42 can teach me how to learn faster. Every college or university out there is teaching you how to learn at a slower and more academic rate, so this is a huge plus.
I have always been into tech stuff, I have taught myself codding and am very good at it. I don't handle so well the administrative part of my business. I use GnuCash, Latex, software and lenguages such as c, c++, java, BASH and POWERSHELL. I use Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Cubieboard, Odroid and Orange Pi. I have screwed my PC several times, formatting and partitioning them, installing and removing different operative systems, messing with the bios and overclocking the processor. For me this is a hobby, so I find it hard to stop at the end of the day. I like DIY, and I look up tutorials a lot. I built a CNC from scratch. I spend a lot of time learning, in my spare time and I want to continue learning.
I want to make a change in the world. I want to be part of a universe in which everyone takes care of everyone else. You know how "they" say that mankind is devolving? I want to prove them wrong, that we can be great, better, good. I like to help other people, and I can now feel happiness in it. I have grown and changed. I would like to be an example of someone who is consistently working to be the best person he can be, building himself and with the help of others.
I think that a lot of people are quite limited in their thinking. They tend to only see things from one perspective, and they often don't question their assumptions or look at things from different angles. This can lead to a lot of problems, both for individuals and for society as a whole. I believe that it is important for everyone to try to think more broadly and deeply about the world around them, and to question everything they take for granted. Only by doing this can we hope to truly understand the world and ourselves, and make better decisions throughout our lives.
 I want to express my appreciation for the community you are building at 42 Heilbronn. I think that this unconventional approach to education is attractive to people with a growth mindset and high intrinsic motivation. I am writing to apply for financial aid to start my studies on the next kickoff date.
 I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith, I am the eldest of three children. As a child, I had to work in my dad's forge to help the family make ends meet. I am very proud of my humble beginnings and I believe that they have made me into the hardworking and resilient person that I am today.
I started coding when I was 13 years old and it quickly became one of my favorite hobbies. When I was 16, I took part in a local programming competition and placed first in my province. This experience showed me that coding was something that I could be really good at and motivated me to continue learning. A few years later, I completed a Software Engineering course at a university in Buenos Aires. Even though I enjoyed the course, I knew that it wasn't teaching me everything I needed to know to become a great software engineer. That's why 42 Heilbronn caught my attention: its unique approach covers not only technical skills but also important soft skills like problem solving, teamwork and creative thinking.
Since moving out of my parents' house, I have been working various jobs to support myself while also taking online courses on Coursera (including an Introduction to Computer Science course) and Udacity (including a Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Nanodegree program). My long-term goal is to find a job as a software engineer in Germany so that I can be closer to my sister who lives here. In order for me to achieve this goal, studying at 42 Heilbronn is essential since it will give me the chance not only improvemy coding skills but also learn about German culture and practice speaking German on a daily basis with other students from all over the world.
Apart from being passionate about code, some of my other interests include photography, cooking and hiking. On weekends you'll often find me exploring new trails in the area or trying out new recipes at home.
 I am a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Heilbronn, Germany. My major is International Business Administration and my minor is Information Systems. In addition to that, I have been studying computer science for two years now as an elective subject. This has given me a strong foundation in programming and data structures &amp; algorithms. The reason why I want to study at 42 Heilbronn is because it offers an innovative approach to learning which really appeals to me. The project-based learning style will allow me to apply the theoretical knowledge that I have acquired during my studies so far. Moreover, the fact that there are no teachers or lectures but only mentors who are there to help when needed creates a very stimulating environment in which one can learn a lot by doing. Finally, the international atmosphere at 42 Heilbronn with students from all over the world is another factor that makes this school attractive to me.
 With this letter, I want to describe why I should be the one to receive a scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn for the upcoming Fall semester. When I was 14 years old, my family lost everything in a flood; our home and all of our belongings were ruined by the water. Even though we had insurance, it barely covered what we needed to get back on our feet again. My parents did not have money left over for things like extracurricular activities or college savings accounts, but they always encouraged me to pursue my studies and follow my dreams.
I am now 19 years old and about to finish my first year of college at community college. While I have loved learning and doing well in school, it has been a challenge financially. I have worked multiple jobs throughout high school and during breaks from college in order to help support myself and pay for tuition, books, and other expenses. Despite these challenges, I have maintained a GPA of 3.8 and completed nearly 30 credits so far. 
I am writing to apply for the 42 Heilbronn scholarship because attending this coding bootcamp would allow me to focus on my studies without worrying about how I will afford tuition or other associated costs. It would also mean being able to network with like-minded individuals and accessing resources that could help further my career goals. This opportunity would make pursuing my dream of becoming a software engineer possible, something that may otherwise be out of reach due to financial constraints.
 With this letter, I want to describe why I am applying to receive a scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn.
 I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith. As a child, I was exposed to the family business of making metal art.
 This is where my passion for sculpting originated. Living in Argentina, I became very interested in both ancient and modern cultures as well as their traditions. After high school, these interests led me to study archaeology at university which I completed with excellent grades.
For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in how things work and taking them apart to see how they are put together. This curiosity led me to study physics in high school and then pursue a degree in electrical engineering at university. My studies have given me a strong foundation in mathematics and physics, which I believe will be essential in becoming a successful engineer.
I am confident that I have what it takes to succeed at 42 Heilbronn. I am a hard worker who is not afraid of challenge. In addition, I am excited to learn more about engineering and meet other like-minded students from all over the world.
Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 With this letter, I want to express my interest and describe why I am applying for a scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn. The main reason why I am applying is that 42 Heilbronn offers study courses in English and therefore globalization at university, which helps students prepare for work life stress-free. Apart from the language barrier, other things like cultural differences can create big problems both inside and outside of school if one does not take into account prior to studying there.
 In addition, I strongly believe that an education should not only be about acquiring theoretical knowledge but also developing practical skills; And this is where 42 Heilbronn really shines. The unique pedagogy used here through which students are taught to think creatively and solve complex problems will definitely help me a lot in my future career as an engineer or software developer.

 My first experience with programming came during my work on an archaeological dig where I used a basic statistical software program to help analyze our findings. This experience piqued my interest and after some research, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in web development. Thus, upon returning home from the dig, I started taking online courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I could learn more about coding and its potential applications.

 Dear 42 Staff,

 With this letter, I want to express my interest and describe why I am applying for a scholarship to study at 42. 
 I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith. As a child, I was very curious and I liked to take things apart just to see how they worked.
 As a teenager, this curiosity led me to flash memory devices such as controllers and BIOSes for low-cost Chinese hardware that could be repurposed for other uses. This is what first piqued my interest in software development: 
 the challenge of understanding how something works by reading its code, which can be seen as a kind of puzzle. When I turned 18, I joined the Army where I served for two years.
 Following my military service, I studied electronic engineering at university for four years but soon realized that it wasn’t really what I wanted to do with my life. So instead of finishing my degree, I decided to move to San Francisco in 2016 with just $500 in my pocket.

 At first, it was tough getting used to living in a new country without knowing anyone or speaking the language fluently. But after a few months, things started looking up when I got a job as an Technician Apprentice at 42 Silicon Valley which included taking introductory courses on various programming languages such as C, Assembly language and JavaScript among others before moving on to more specialized subjects like Linux kernel development and reverse engineering (which are some of My areas of interests). 

 With this letter, I want to describe why I am applying to receive a scholarship to study at 42 Heilbronn. I hope that my story will prove to you why I am a deserving candidate.

I was born in Colombia, but ever since I was little, I have always wanted to live abroad. After high school, when it came time to decide what university to attend, there were two options: stay in my comfort zone or venture out into the unknown. I chose the latter and moved to Mexico City by myself to study computer engineering at Tec de Monterrey.

 However, after two years of living there, I realized that Mexico was not where I wanted to be; it was then that 42 Heilbronn caught my attention. The philosophy of the school - learning by doing - is something that really resonated with me and made me want to be a part of the community. On top of that, Heilbronn is such a beautiful city!

 Consequently, last August 2019, I packed up my bags once again and took another leap of faith by moving here alone. Despite not knowing anyone or speaking any German whatsoever, it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. The people here are so friendly and welcoming and 42 Heilbronn has completely surpassed all my expectations! 

 Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances



Sincerely, 
[Your name]


Dear 42 staff,
I want to express my appreciation for the community you are building you are doing at 42 Heilbronn. I am writing to apply for financial aid to start my studies next October. 
 I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith. As a child, I was always very active and curious. I loved to explore the world around me, which is probably why I ended up studying Science at university. 
I came to Germany two years ago with my boyfriend. We both wanted to study abroad and improve our German skills. So far, we have loved living here! The people are so friendly and the landscape is beautiful.
We visited 42 Heilbronn last week and we were really impressed by the school and the community you are building there. I am passionate about learning new things and I am excited to start my journey in coding at 42 Heilbronn.
However, I would not be able to afford the tuition without financial aid. My parents are unable to help me financially and my boyfriend is still studying himself. That is why I am writing to ask for your help in funding my studies at 42 Heilbronn next October. 
Thank you for your time and consideration!

I believe that studying mathematics will help me hone my problem-solving abilities, as well as improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures. Additionally, I feel that a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics would give me a strong foundation on which to pursue further studies in computer science or related fields if I so choose. 
All things considered, I am confident that studying mathematics at this university would be beneficial for me both academically and personally, and I look forward to being given the opportunity to do so.

 With this letter, I want to express my interest and describe why I am applying to study a Bachelor of Mathematics at this university. I decided to apply to this program due to several reasons, one of the most important is because I want to improve my conceptual thinking, to further develop my ability to create effective and more efficient algorithms. I am a competitive programmer, I often compete in programming contests.
 I was born in Argentina. My native language is Spanish and I speak English fluently. My mom is a housewife and my dad is a blacksmith. As a child, I was very curious to understand how things work. I have a lot of memories of me dismantling toys to see them from the inside. My parents would say that I was just breaking my toys. In hindsight, I think I was just interested in understanding the internal mechanisms of things. I wanted to know how each part of the system related to each other. This is probably the personality trait that led me to learn about software development.
 The first time I heard the word algorithm I was around 14 years old. It was the last week of the school year and my math teacher had brought a few Rubik’s cubes to class to entertain us. I clearly remember how every time I was a couple of pieces away from completing the first face, I partially disassembled the other part. I was confused, so I went to my teacher and told him that I couldn’t place a corner without taking apart the edges. He showed me a short sequence of steps with which I could put the corners in their place. He also explained to me that any specific sequence of actions was called an algorithm. And told me that if I learned a certain number of algorithms I could solve the cube regardless of its current state. At this time the concept of algorithms was too abstract for me. But I understood that to solve the cube I only needed to memorize certain steps. My teacher also encouraged me to learn them on my own in the summer. I spent the first weeks of that summer writing down a cheat sheet with all the algorithms I needed. My family was very impressed when I could solve it in a matter of minutes. Although deep down I knew it seemed a lot more difficult than it was.
 A couple of years later I rediscovered the term algorithm when I was taking my first programming class. In the beginning, when I started learning how to code I thought that the hardest part about programming was the syntax. I was perplexed by how a simple misplaced punctuation sign could crash my program. Later, when I became more familiar with writing code, I completed my first algorithms and data structures course. I began to realize that writing the program is the easy part. The complicated part is making the necessary abstractions in your mind. These abstractions are visualizations that I have to create in my mind, in which the given data is modified by at least one procedure to generate a result. Of course, any conceptual process I encounter during competition can be expressed as a finite number of mathematical operations. From here is where my interest in the study of this career emerges. 
 Nowadays, I compete in programming at least twice a week. I love the feeling of competition. I feel in a flow state when I read the statement and try to deconstruct the problem into simple subtasks. I enjoy the adrenaline rush when I am typing the last lines of my code as fast as I can. I feel satisfied when I press the Submit button and I see an Accepted green status. I am constantly learning new concepts. From number theory and algebra to graph theory algorithms. Sometimes there are new ideas that are very hard to understand on my own, and I have to spend a long time with them. I think that if I had the opportunity to study with the qualified teachers that this university offers, I would be able to enhance my mathematical intuition. Having a good mathematical intuition is an essential component in competition because the tight time and memory limits usually make the brute force approach impractical.

This is probably the personality trait that led me to learn about software development.
 The first time I heard the word algorithm I was around 14 years old. It was the last week of the school year and my math teacher had brought a few Rubik’s cubes to class to entertain us. I clearly remember how every time I was a couple of pieces away from completing the first face, I partially disassembled the other part. I was confused, so I went to my teacher and told him that I couldn’t place a corner without taking apart the edges. He showed me a short sequence of steps with which I could put the corners in their place. He also explained to me that any specific sequence of actions was called an algorithm. And told me that if I learned a certain number of algorithms I could solve the cube regardless of its current state. At this time the concept of algorithms was too abstract for me. But I understood that to solve the cube I only needed to memorize certain steps. My teacher also encouraged me to learn them on my own in the summer. I spent the first weeks of that summer writing down a cheat sheet with all the algorithms I needed. My family was very impressed when I could solve it in a matter of minutes. Although deep down I knew it seemed a lot more difficult than it was.
 A couple of years later I rediscovered the term algorithm when I was taking my first programming class. In the beginning, when I started learning how to code I thought that the hardest part about programming was the syntax. I was perplexed by how a simple misplaced punctuation sign could crash my program. Later, when I became more familiar with writing code, I completed my first algorithms and data structures course. I began to realize that writing the program is the easy part. The complicated part is making the necessary abstractions in your mind. These abstractions are visualizations that I have to create in my mind, in which the given data is modified by at least one procedure to generate a result. Of course, any conceptual process I encounter during competition can be expressed as a finite number of mathematical operations. From here is where my interest in the study of this career emerges. 
 Nowadays, I compete in programming at least twice a week. I love the feeling of competition. I feel in a flow state when I read the statement and try to deconstruct the problem into simple subtasks. I enjoy the adrenaline rush when I am typing the last lines of my code as fast as I can. I feel satisfied when I press the Submit button and I see an Accepted green status. I am constantly learning new concepts. From number theory and algebra to graph theory algorithms. Sometimes there are new ideas that are very hard to understand on my own, and I have to spend a long time with them. I think that if I had the opportunity to study with the qualified teachers that this university offers, I would be able to enhance my mathematical intuition. Having a good mathematical intuition is an essential component in competition because the tight time and memory limits usually make the brute force approach impractical.

Dear Scholarship Committee,</div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-item-header">7:18 PM</div><div class="timeline-item-content">Summarize this for a second-grade student:

&lt;aside&gt;
☝ 25.10.21: If you are already a student at 42 Heilbronn: currently there are no further scholarships available, if your financial situation is very severe, please contact us directly with the request to setup a meeting (admin@42heilbronn.de). As soon as the situation changes we will adjust this message.

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;
💡 Here you can find information about our scholarship process and see if you're eligible for one.

&lt;/aside&gt;

We want to prepare as many talented people with coding skills as possible. We are happy to offer training free of charge. For people who cannot support their cost of living, we have devised a scholarship program. This program is supported by our partner companies. Scholarships are limited to one year. On a scholarship program, you are required to study full-time, and not acquire any other source of income in the meantime.

- **Who's eligible?**
    
    The scholarships are for those people who will start studying at&nbsp;42&nbsp;Heilbronn and who can’t afford their living on their own, respectively by support from family/friends, their own savings or a part-time job.
    
- **What is it for?**
    
    We want people to focus fully on the&nbsp;42&nbsp;and the community, and not extend their learning time with serving and handing out newspapers. With the scholarships we want to support you with your rent and other cost of living. 
    
    You can receive a maximum of 922 € (equivalent of german Bafög) in funding, depending on your needs. This is max. 325 € for rent (with proof), 427 € for your other living expenses and 170 € for health insurance.
    
- **How can I apply?**
    
    1. Pass the Piscine and get your admission mail
    
    2. Think about your situation, if you are in need
    
    3. Fill out the form ([typeform](https://42heilbronn.typeform.com/scholarship))
    
    4. Don’t forget to attach your motivation letter
    
    5. The&nbsp;42&nbsp;staff will review all applications and let you know about your funding as soon as possible.
    
    Any questions regarding scholarships please direct them to: admin@42heilbronn.de
    
- **Application form**
    
    [https://42heilbronn.typeform.com/scholarship](https://42heilbronn.typeform.com/scholarship)
    
- **Application deadlines**
    
    **You are a student at 42 Heilbronn** 
    
    within 2 weeks
    
    **You are not yet a student at 42 Heilbronn**
    
    If you are not sure which kick-off date you want to choose, please consult this page, we will always inform about the application deadlines of the next kick-off. 
    
    Prior piscines (than the ones stated below) for start in October 2022:
    
    - apply from 01.06.2022 until 18.07.2022
    
    Piscine June 2022: 
    
    - apply until 18.07.2022
    - decision by 42 until 25.07.2022
    
    Piscine July 2022:
    
    - apply until 29.08.2022
    - decision by 42 until 05.09.2022
    
- **Note**
    
    If there are more qualified applicants than available scholarships, we are going to apply a randomized lottery system.
    
    If your scholarship amount is reduced (e.g. 500 EUR) it is ok if you work a part time job (e.g. 450-EUR Job). Just check back with us before doing so. 
    
    You will receive the first payment latest until the third working day after your start date (if you showed up) and then constantly on a monthly basis until latest the second day of the respective month (mostly even prior to that).
    
    You will only receive payment once you have handed in all relevant proof (e.g. rental contract, health insurance cost).
    
- **What to strive for**
    
    Once you have been admitted to receive a scholarship we like to see you progress at 42. What we expect of you as a rule of thumb is the following:
    
    - 42 is your priority
    - if you have a full scholarship you should as a rough guidance spend ~35hours per week (log time) and finish ~1 level per month until level 4. After level 4 it is one level per 2 months.
    - if you have a half-scholarship (&lt;500EUR) you should as a rough guidance spend ~15hours per week (log time) and finish ~0,5 level per month until level 4. After level 4 it is 0,5 level per 2 months.
    
    Please be aware that this is not a strict rule, but should give you some guidance.

Dear Scholarship Committee,

I am writing to apply for the scholarship to study in Germany.

I am a highly motivated and hard-working student, and I am very interested in studying in Germany. I have excellent grades and a strong interest in the German language and culture.

I am confident that I will be a successful student in Germany and I am eager to learn more about the culture and the language. I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to contribute to the German community.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to study in Germany and I am confident that I would make the most of this opportunity.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
